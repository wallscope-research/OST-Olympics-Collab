ath1 - data for green bars in athlete view. Selected athlete's age is 24.
ath2 - parallel coordinates plot in athlete view.
sport1 - bars for number of athletes and medals per continent over time.
sport2 - data for line charts per sex over time. "mage" is "male age" and "fweight" is "female weight" for example.
con1 - parallel coordinates plot in continent view. Yes it's the same as ath2 but called "continent"... I'm lazy.
con2 - line chart showing number of athletes and medals over time in the continent view.
