# The Olympics: How to Build a Linked Data Application

We combined RDFox and Wallscope's Platform to create [this demo](https://wallscope.rdfox.tech/) and there is an article describing how we made it [here](https://medium.com/wallscope/the-olympics-how-to-build-a-linked-data-application-f6f844b3a19c). This was a collaboration between Wallscope and Oxford Semantic Technologies.
